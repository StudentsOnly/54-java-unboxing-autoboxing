### Exercise: Autoboxing and Unboxing - List of Integers

#### Objective:

- Practice autoboxing and unboxing in Java by creating a program that works with a list of integers using both primitive and wrapper classes.

#### Instructions:

- Create a class called IntegerList to work with a list of integers using both primitive and wrapper classes.
- In IntegerList, perform the following operations:
  -	Create an ArrayList of integers (use wrapper class Integer).
  -	Add integers to the list using both primitive int values and Integer wrapper objects (autoboxing).
  -	Retrieve and display integers from the list using both primitive data types and wrapper classes (unboxing).
  -	Perform a mathematical operation (e.g., sum) on the integers from the list.
